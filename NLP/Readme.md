Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP is concerned with enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both valuable and meaningful. 

I have implemented 2 python projects in NLP concerning various aspects of Financial Sentiment Analysis.
