GAM, which stands for Graphs, Algorithms, and Mining, is a broad and interdisciplinary field that combines concepts from graph theory, computer science, data mining, and machine learning. GAM research focuses on understanding, analyzing, and extracting valuable information from complex data structures known as graphs. 

I have implemented 2 python projects in GAM demonstrating:<br>
A. Various Network Measurements of Random Graph using networkx package.<br>
B. Clustering of Astro Physics Collaboration network using Graph Min-Cut/Max Flow Algo [Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm for Maximum Flow]
