Speech Recognition using Deep Learning (CNN/RNN/LSTM/GRU)

1. Select three research/journal papers from reputed sources like IEEE/Springer or ACM that focus on the application (Speech Recognition) of CNN/RNN/Transformer networks in your chosen domain.
2. Compare above three papers and present your findings in tabular form.
3. Implement any one Research Paper based on Speech Recognition using CNN/RNN/Transformer Architecture in Python TensorFlow Keras Libraries.
