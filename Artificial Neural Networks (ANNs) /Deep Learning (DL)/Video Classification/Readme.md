•	Video Classification is implemented using CNN and RNN architecture. <br>
•	Training & Testing Dataset are downloaded from https://pixabay.com/ & stored locally to be used in this project.<br>
•	Due to space constraint, only few videos (of category car, forest & space) are downloaded & used in this project. As a result, accuracy of this project is not very good.<br>
